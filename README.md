## 📘 Overview

This research dissertation investigates and compares the performance of six prominent machine learning algorithms in the development of credit scoring models for microcredit institutions. Specifically, it addresses the persistent problem of credit misclassification, which has financial and operational consequences for microfinance banks.

The following models were evaluated:
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree (CART)
- k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN)

## 🎯 Objectives

1. To develop classification models for credit scoring using supervised machine learning techniques.
2. To compare model performance and identify the most accurate and reliable method for credit risk prediction.
3. To determine the key features contributing to loan default and delinquency.

## 🧪 Methodology

The study uses client data obtained from **Gombe Microfinance Bank Ltd** (2020–2021), comprising demographic, financial, and behavioral variables.

Key steps in the methodology:
- Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis
- Feature selection (e.g., Garson’s algorithm for ANN)
- Model training and testing using R statistical software
- Model evaluation via:
  - Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score

## 📈 Key Findings

- **k-Nearest Neighbour** and **Artificial Neural Networks** demonstrated the highest predictive performance with AUC values of **0.9833** and **0.9062**, respectively.
- **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machine** models yielded moderate AUC values (~0.85).
- All models achieved appreciable classification accuracy, yet **ANN** and **k-NN** outperformed others across most metrics.

---

## 📌 Highlights

- Applied real microcredit data from a Nigerian microfinance institution.
- Models implemented using R with packages such as `MASS`, `neuralnet`, `e1071`, `rpart`, `class`, and `pROC`.
- Incorporates advanced machine learning techniques into practical financial applications.
- Identifies key predictors influencing default probability, such as **ROI**, **Approved Amount**, and **Number of Dependents**.
